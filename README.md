# VerySimple ML & AI Code

1- Very_Simple_Neural_Network.js
You can not get simpler than this Neural Network, to run you need to install Node and at the root folder after you downloaded  the code just run the code at the terminal (node Very_Simple_Neural_Network.js) . 

The code will use x, y to predict a simple linear equation(A) from (x&y), alpha is the learning rate and epochs are the number the loop gets executed. The error then  gets multiplied by the learning rate.  

The final part is the line formula that get generated
